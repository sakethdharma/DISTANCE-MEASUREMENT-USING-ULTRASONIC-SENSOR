# DISTANCE-MEASUREMENT-USING-ULTRASONIC-SENSOR
An ultrasonic sensor houses a transducer that emits high-frequency, inaudible acoustic waves in one direction when the transducer element vibrates. If the waves strike and bounce off an object, the transducer receives the echoed signal. The sensor then determines its distance from the object based on the length of time between the initial sound burst and the echo's return. Ultrasonic sensors require fairly accurate timing circuitry, so acoustic sensors really require a processor of some sort to drive them. Ultrasonic sensors should be a first choice for detecting clear objects, liquids, dense materials of any surface type (rough, smooth, shiny) and irregular shaped objects. This makes them one of the most ideal choices for measuring the height of containers which could be of different shapes, sizes, color and material. The transmitter transmits the ultrasonic waves towards the object and according to the time taken by echo from the transmitter to object and object to receiver, the distance is calculated. If the obstacle is in the designated range the comparator sends the signal to the microcontroller which in turn sends an output signal.  Time of flight (TOF) estimation method. TOF represents the time in which the ultrasonic wave propagates from the transmitter to the target and then back to the receiver. TOF divided by 2 is the time required to get the distance from the emitter and target.
